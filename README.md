McAfferty's Electraby
=====================

Project to generate an electronic rendering of McAfferty's Lullaby (Mechanism
for Two Marimbas) by Ernesto Illescas-Peláez.


ABOUT
-----

Using Python as scripting language and Csound as synthesis engine, this project
will render (a version) of McAffarty's Electraby. The original algorithm for
the piece can be found in Ernesto Illescas-Peláez Master's thesis "An Organizing
Tide of Chaos - Resonances of Chaos Theory in a Composer's Craftsmanship" (link
to the full text below). The idea behind the code is that new versions of the
piece can be rendered by modifing initial conditions (or even the source code).
